The death of Li Wenliang has shaken China like an earthquake. He was a young doctor who was reprimanded by Chinese police for alerting colleagues to a new virus that has now killed more than 1,300 people, Dr Li among them (see Obituary). There was nation- wide soul-searching when the ophthalmologist told Chinese media, days before his death on February 6th in Wuhan, Hubei province, that silencing truth-tellers can make a country sick. “I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society,” he said. </br>	
#李文亮医生之死如一场地震般震动了中国。他是一位年轻的医生，因为提醒同事注意一种新型病毒而受到中国警方训诫，这种病毒现在已经杀死1,300多人，李医生也在其中（参见讣告）。在2月6日于湖北武汉去世的几天前，全国上下兴起一片反思，当这位眼科医生告诉中国媒体，让讲真话的人闭嘴会使一个国家生病。“我认为一个健康的社会不该只有一种声音，”他说道。</br>	
There is special outrage that this everyman-physician died with the charge of rumour-mongering still on his police file. “What kind of society have we created?” asked Chinese netizens, with a mixture of anger and shame. In the hours after Dr Li’s death nearly 2m of them shared or viewed a hashtag meaning “I want freedom of speech”, before it was deleted by censors. Open letters and petitions have called on the Communist Party’s leaders to hon- our the constitution’s neglected guarantee of free expression, arguing that truth-telling saves lives. “We should learn from Li Wenliang’s death,” said an academic in Wuhan behind one petition.</br>	
特别令人愤慨的是，这位普通的医生死后仍被警方记录在案，罪名是散布谣言。“我们创造了什么样的社会？中国网民充满愤怒和羞耻地发问。在李医生死后的几个小时中，有近200万网民在审查员删除之前分享或查看了一个意为“我要言论自由”的主题标签。公开信和请愿书呼吁共产党领导人尊重被忽视的宪法对言论自由的保障，承认说真话可以拯救生命。“我们应该从李文亮的死中吸取教训，”一位武汉的学者在一份请愿书后面说。</br>	
Party leaders will not learn to embrace free speech or political pluralism. They know their history and that in Chinese tradition the death of an honest man, wronged by those in power, can be a potent, dangerous event. Many times over the centuries, public gatherings to mourn such people have sparked political crises, including in Communist times. Party chiefs have duly rushed to co- opt Dr Li as a hero whose suffering should be blamed on isolated, local wrongdoing. To bolster that idea, officials have been sent from Beijing to look into his case. Global Times, a nationalist tab- loid, has stressed in its reporting that Dr Li was a loyal party member. It alleges that calls to honour Dr Li’s memory are being whipped up by “anti-China forces” abroad and in Hong Kong. </br>	
党的领导人不会学着去接受言论自由或政治多元化。他们了解自己的历史，在中国传统中，一个被当权者冤枉的老实人的死，可能是一个潜在的危险事件。几个世纪以来，为悼念这些人而举行的公开集会已经引发了多次政治危机，包括在共产主义时代。党的领导人适时地将李医生打造为一个英雄，他的遭遇应当归咎于孤立的地方不法行为。为支持这一观点，北京已派出官员调查他的案子。 民族主义小报《环球时报》在报道中强调李医生是一位忠诚的党员。 它声称，那些纪念李医生的呼吁是收到了海外和香港“反华势力”的煽动。</br>	
After a few days in which Xi Jinping, the country’s leader, was relatively invisible, the propaganda machine has now cleared front pages for accounts of his virus-control work. Mr Xi made a rare public appearance, visiting hospital and community offices in Beijing. Three days later he reshuffled the leadership of Hubei, the worst-hit area. The state news agency, Xinhua, called him the “commander of the people’s war against the epidemic”. To some readers, the martial title may sound stirring. Others may fear it leaves little room for scientific debate or scrutiny by outsiders such as journalists, notably those brave Chinese reporters who have done remarkable work in recent weeks in their efforts to cover the virus’s spread. In a war instructions from the top are orders. </br>	
在国家领导人习近平相对隐形的几天之后，这台宣传机器现在已经为他的病毒控制工作清理了头版报道。习近平罕见地公开露面，访问了北京的医院和社区办事处。三天后，他改组了受灾最严重的湖北省领导层。国家新闻社，新华社称他为“人民抗击流行病战争的指挥官”。对于某些读者来说，这个军事化的称号听起来很激动人心。其他人可能会担心，这几乎没有为诸如记者之类的外部人员留下空间进行科学辩论或审查空间，尤其是那些勇敢的中国记者，他们在最近几周为遏制病毒的传播做出了卓越的工作。在战争中，上级的指示就是命令。</br>	
Censorship is being tightened, ending a brief period of unusual liberty for social-media users. The country’s largest internet plat- forms have been placed under “special supervision” by cyber-regulators, with extra controls on anything resembling citizen journalism. Yet shows of authority cannot stop the public from brooding about Dr Li. As millions of Chinese read and share ac- counts of his short life and tragic death, they are being forced to devote unusual attention to their social compact with the country’s authoritarian rulers. </br>	
审查制度正在加强控制，结束了社交媒体用户短暂的而不寻常自由期。这个国家最大的互联网平台已受到网络监管者的“特别监管”，对任何类似公民新闻的事物进行了额外的控制。然而，展示威权并不能阻止公众对李医生的沉思。 当数以百万计的中国人阅读并分享他短暂的生命和悲惨的死亡经历时，他们被迫对与该国独裁统治者的社会契约给予不寻常的关注。</br>	
Sometimes adherence to that compact seems almost pain- less—for instance last October, when many Chinese expressed deep, unfeigned pride on the 70th anniversary of a People’s Republic with shiny mega-cities, high-speed trains and aircraft-carriers that awe the world. Unbidden, many Chinese credit one-party rule with offering efficiency and stability, especially when democratic countries seem mired in dysfunction. </br>	
有时，遵守这一契约似乎几乎没有什么痛苦——例如去年10月，许多中国人在人民共和国建国70周年之际表达了深刻且毫无掩饰的骄傲，闪亮的大都会，高速列车以及威服四海的航空母舰。无可否认，许多中国人相信一党执政能够带来效率和稳定，尤其是在民主国家似乎陷入了功能失调的情况下。</br>	
Such confidence is harder now. Dr Li’s last weeks on Earth oblige his fellow citizens to confront the costs of a system without free speech, an uncensored press or independent legal system. Many have read the humiliating letter that police in Wuhan made him sign, agreeing that his truth-telling was in fact a lie that “gravely disturbed social order”. Not content with forcing the doc- tor to deny reality, police added school-bully phrases, asking him to write “I can” and “I understand” when asked if he would now calm down and heed the police, or face legal penalties. </br>	
这种信心现在变得更加艰难。李医生在世的最后几周迫使他的同胞不得不面对这个系统的代价，这个系统没有言论自由，新闻自由和独立司法体系。 许多人已经读过武汉警方让他签字的那封羞辱信，认为他说的真话实际上是“严重扰乱社会秩序”的谎言。 不满足于强迫医生否认现实，警方增加了校园恶霸式的字眼，当被问到他现在是否会冷静下来，听从警察否则面临法律制裁时，要求他写下”我能”和”我明白”。</br>	
Lots of patriotic, law-abiding Chinese have glimpsed for them- selves the casual, swaggering sadism of a system without account- ability, in which the law is just another instrument for frightening the defenceless. They can see how, when agents of the state fear no external checks and balances, it is rational for them to bury bad news, right up until a crisis becomes too big to hide: a dynamic that builds instability into the way China is run. </br>	
许多爱国守法的中国人自己也看到了一个没有问责能力的制度，它是随意而傲慢的虐待狂，在这种制度下，法律只是另一种恫吓手无寸铁者的工具。他们可以看到，当国家机构不担心外部制衡时，他们掩盖坏消息是很合理的，除非危机扩大到无法掩盖：这种动态将不稳定因素带入中国的运行方式。</br>	
Even today’s tight censorship is teaching bleak lessons to millions of apolitical folk who normally never see their posts deleted, or no- tice when news reports vanish after causing too much fuss. Some may be comforted by familiar propaganda about good national leaders let down by bad apples in the provinces. Such tales draw on traditions with deep roots, involving virtuous, faraway emperors and local tyrants. The gains are short-term, however. Each attack on local corruption or bungling stokes public distrust and makes the case for further centralisation. But China is too big to be ruled from its capital, let alone by one man. Even those who think Mr Xi a great commander know that he needs good lieutenants. </br>	
即使如今的严厉的审查制度给数以百万计的非政治人士上了惨淡的一课，他们通常从不会看到自己的帖子被删除，也不会注意到某些引起太多麻烦的新闻报道消失。一些人可能会被关于优秀的国家领导人对各省的害群之马感到失望这种耳熟能详的宣传安慰到。这类故事借鉴了根深蒂固的传统，包括贤明而遥远的皇帝和土豪劣绅。不过，收益是短期的。每次针对地方腐败或粗暴行径的攻击都会激起公众的不信任，并为进一步的中央集权提供理由。但是中国太大了，不能从首都进行统治，更不用说一个人了。即使是那些认为习先生是个伟大的指挥官的人也知道，他需要优秀的中尉。</br>	
None of this presages a revolution. The virus is a hard test for the party, but it has survived worse. A vanishingly small number of Chinese see a viable alternative to the social compact that binds them to their rulers. Still, Dr Li’s death has obliged an unusually broad range of citizens to contemplate the unhappy compromises needed merely to survive in a bossy, paranoid dictatorship. After some good years, a fresh crisis has reminded millions of Chinese that their rulers define truth as they see fit. Public anger about Dr Li’s fate will fade, just as countries recover from earthquakes. But those who feel the ground shake never forget or trust in its solidity the same way again. </br>	
这些都不是革命的预兆。这种病毒对党来说是一个严峻的考验，但它的存活情况更糟。越来越少的中国人看到一个可以取代他们与统治者联系起来的社会契约的可行选择。尽管如此，李医生的死还是迫使异乎寻常的广大公民去思考那些不幸的妥协，这些妥协仅仅是为了在一个专横、偏执的独裁统治中生存。在一段美好的岁月之后，一场新的危机提醒了数百万中国人，他们的统治者根据自己的意愿来定义真理。公众对李医生命运的愤怒将会消退，就像各国从地震中恢复一样。但那些感受到大地震动的人永远不会忘记或再次以同样的方式相信它的坚不可摧。</br>
